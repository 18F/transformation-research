# Best practices in government digital transformation

An 18F research team investigated what makes modern digital practices “stick” within a government entity, beyond a single innovation project.

## Why this question?

People at every level of government are working to improve how they use modern tools and methods to empower workers, connect with constituents, save money, and provide demonstrably better services. Despite these efforts, very few agencies are sustaining strong digital work more broadly.

Correspondingly, there are many resources on how to do innovative digital projects well, but few outline how to sustain modern practices beyond an initial project or prototype. In the course of working with partner agencies, 18F has identified the need for such resources.
