# Best Practices in Government Digital Transformation

Current efforts at digital transformation—moving government agencies and offices into the digital era, using modern tools and methodologies, and taking a "digital first" approach to providing public services— are taking place all over the country at every level of government.

At present, there has been no comprehensive survey of what tools and practices have been most effective. Our goal is to lead a comprehensive research project to interview transformation teams across Federal, city, and state governments (and possibly other governments, and relevant commercial enterprise efforts, as well) to understand what has worked, what hasn’t, and why.

Our intended output of this research is one central, living repository of information about best practices for digital transformation inside government (most likely a website with appropriate acknowledgements, pointers, and citations, however, part of the research itself will help form what kind of final resource will be most useful and accessible for the agencies we are trying to serve).

This repo is the home for this project's findings, methods, planning and timeline documents. Visit the repo wiki for all the things.
