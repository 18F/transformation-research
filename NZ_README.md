# Best practices in government digital transformation

**tl;dr: [to the wiki](https://github.com/18F/transformation-research/wiki)!**


Weâ€™re performing research that we hope will eventually help decision-makers in government better understand some of the underlying factors that enable modern digital practices to take root in a sustainable way - beyond a single innovative project or pilot.

**Our Approach**

Currently, we are synthesizing insights that we're gathering by:

* conducting interviews with government employees at federal, state and local levels who have first hand experience working on digital transformation projects - both successful ones and failed ones

* reviewing case studies from private industry which is years ahead of government in terms of adopting digital practices  

* reviewing case studies from major consultancies that provide transformation and innovation services to government, and

* learning about the laws and policies that both constrain and push government agencies to adopt new digital practices.
